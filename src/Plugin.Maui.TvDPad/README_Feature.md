# Plugin.Maui.TvDPad - Feature documentation

This feature provides TV D-Pad (directional pad) support for .NET MAUI applications.

Formerly this project was named `Plugin.Maui.DPad`. It has been renamed to `Plugin.Maui.TvDPad` to better reflect its focus on TV D-Pad navigation.

## Usage

- Add the `Plugin.Maui.TvDPad` package to your project.
- Initialize and subscribe to focus/navigation events as described in the API docs.

## Notes

- References in older examples or documentation that mention `Plugin.Maui.DPad` should be updated to `Plugin.Maui.TvDPad`.
- Platform-specific implementations live in the `Plugin.Maui.TvDPad` project files.
